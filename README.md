# Monte-carlo-option-pricing
This project uses the Monte Carlo method to estimate the price of a European call option. It simulates stock price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and calculates the option payoff at expiration.

Features 
- Simulates thousands of stock price paths  
- Calculates option payoffs and discounts to present value  
- Visualizes simulated stock price trajectories
   
Concepts Covered 
- Monte Carlo Simulations  
- Stochastic Processes  
- Black-Scholes Model
  
Technologies Used 
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib
